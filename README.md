# About me:
I'm a Javascript React JS/Native Developer with 3 years of experience (+8 project). Inspired by a strong IT interest since I was a child, i made my vocation a job. 
My experience as a freelance developer has allowed me to experience software development in all its facets and to love it in all its aspects.
I define myself as a lover of good code, I take care in everything I develop, paying particular attention to using all the best practices during the development process. 
I like to follow structured workflow based on scrum methodology and manage gitflow following the guidelines of the git conventional commit.

Keeping myself open to learn new technology stack, my favorite stack of development is the following one: <br />
***HTML5 | CSS3 | Typescript | ReactJS | React Native | Redux | Redux Toolkit | Redux-saga | Styled-components | Git | Storybook | Cypress***
